        <p>So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been looking for a, since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here. I have to tell you about the future. I have a feeling too. I think we need a rematch. Excuse me. Okay. How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. Precisely. Are you sure about this storm? No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids. Right. I can't play. Good morning, Mom. Ah, where're my pants? Let's go. Uh, you mean nobody's asked you? Stop it. Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets. I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother Mcfly, you haven't got a chance, you're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley.</p>
